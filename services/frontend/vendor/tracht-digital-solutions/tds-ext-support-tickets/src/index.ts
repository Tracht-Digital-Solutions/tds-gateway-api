/**
 * Support-tickets extension — the customer↔owner support system, ported from
 * tds-customer-api onto the panel platform. Customers open + follow tickets in
 * the portal; admins triage them. Data lives in this extension's own tables;
 * auth (RBAC + company scoping) comes from the core UserContext, email from the
 * core Mailer.
 *
 * `tickets:read`/`tickets:write` are the portal permissions; admins bypass.
