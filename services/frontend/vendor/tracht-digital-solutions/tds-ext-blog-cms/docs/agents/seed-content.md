# Seeded articles

## `BlogCmsSeedPosts` (`20260728000007`)

Ships the six launch articles, DE + EN. A fresh installation has **no `blog` row**, so
`defaultBlog()` is null and the public list stays empty until an operator acts. The seed
therefore:

- creates the default blog when none exists (reusing an existing one, never adding a second the
  public read wouldn't see),
- seeds the `blog_author` byline,
- writes posts with **`draft = 0` and a non-null `published_at`**. Miss either and the rows exist
  but are invisible, with no error.

Properties to preserve:

- **English rows carry `machine_translated = 0`.** They are hand-written. Flagged as machine
  output, `TranslationSync` would overwrite them with DeepL text on the next German save, and the
  frontend would label them as machine-translated.
- **Idempotent by `(blog_id, slug, lang)`.** `down()` deletes only rows still carrying the seeded
  title **and** body verbatim, so an operator's edits survive a rollback. It keeps the blog and
  author rows.
- **Slugs are mirrored outside this repo:** tds-shared's `blog.posts` fallback teasers (used by
  `tds-landingpage-frontend`'s `Journal.astro`) and `tds-blog-frontend`'s `lib/demoContent.ts`.
  Renaming a slug here without changing those publishes 404 links, and no build checks it.

## Every further article is its own migration

`20260728000007` has run in production and Phinx won't execute it again; a new entry in its
`POSTS` array would only reach fresh installations. Since `20260728000012` each article
migration holds only its `POSTS` and calls `Support\PostSeeder::insert()` / `remove()`, which
owns the blog/author lookup, the INSERT, idempotency and the verbatim-match `down()`.

The equipment and IT-security guides (`000012`–`000019`) embed TDShop affiliate products with
a line `{{produkt:<slug>}}` (rendered by tds-blog-frontend). The slug is the shop's slug **in
the row's language**, seeded in tds-ext-shop `php/db/seed/affiliate*.php`. An unreleased
product renders nothing, so the article must read on without it.

## Content corrections

`BlogCmsSeoRefreshMeta` (`20260728000011`) shortened eight `meta_description` values over 160
characters, guarded by `WHERE meta_description = :old`. An edited description is never
overwritten and a second run changes nothing. Guarding on the **old value** is the pattern for
any later correction.

## Rewrites (`20260728000020`–`000029`)

The 2026-10 editorial pass replaced the text of every seeded article: a `**Kurz gesagt:**` /
`**In short:**` answer first, questions as headings, a `## Häufige Fragen` section, sources for
facts, internal links between articles and links to the matching tools on
`tools.tracht-digital.de`. One `*_blog_cms_rewrite_*` migration per seed file names its seed
(`SEED`) and lists the new title, excerpt, meta and body; `Support\PostRewriter` reads the old
values from the seed class, so no text is duplicated.

- Title, excerpt and body change only where title **and** body are still the seeded ones; the
  meta only where the row now carries the new body and still the seeded (refreshed) meta.
- Slug, category, tags and `published_at` are never touched.
- Never edit a seed's `POSTS` once a rewrite names it: the guard compares against those values.
  A further correction is a new rewrite whose `SEED` is the earlier rewrite file.
- Tool links are absolute: DE `https://tools.tracht-digital.de/tools/<slug>`, EN
  `…/en/tools/<slug>` (same slugs). Article links are `/<slug>` and `/en/<slug>`.

`php/tests/RewriteContentTest.php` checks that every seeded row is rewritten once, product embeds
are kept, meta stays within 80–160, every article opens with the answer and ends with an FAQ of
at least three questions, tool and article links resolve in their language (tool slugs against
the `tds-tool-*` packs when they are checked out next to this repo) and every tool of the pinned
`LINKED_TOOLS` list is linked in both languages. A tool added later needs no article link; link
it in a new rewrite and add it to the list if it should stay covered.

`.gitattributes` pins `*.php` to LF: the article bodies are nowdocs, so a CRLF checkout changes
their text and fails the embed and lead checks.

## `php/tests/SeedContentTest.php`

Reads the constants from the migration files (through a stub for Phinx's base class) and checks
what otherwise fails silently: DE/EN completeness, `published_at` shape, tags usable as URL
segments, column limits, effective meta descriptions within 80–160, no dead entry in the refresh
map, `draft = 0` / `machine_translated = 0` in every INSERT (PostSeeder's included), file-name ↔
class-name mapping and unique version prefixes. Seed files are globbed, so a new article is checked
without being listed. With tds-ext-shop-pkg checked out next to this repo, every product embed
must name an affiliate slug of its own language.
