/**
 * How long a fetched affiliate price may be shown: 24 hours.
 *
 * The Amazon Product Advertising API licence requires a displayed price to come
 * from the API, to carry the time it was retrieved, and to disappear once it is
 * older than a day. The same ceiling is applied to every network — a stale
 * price misleads a reader regardless of who quoted it, and one rule is one
 * thing to get right.
 *
 * ### Why this exists here as well as in the frontend
 *
 * `tds-shared`'s `isPriceStale()` already enforces it in the browser-facing
 * renderer. This is the second, independent floor: the public API strips the
 * price before it leaves the server, so a consumer that forgets the check — a
 * new site, a third-party integration, a debugging fetch pasted into a
 * template — cannot display one anyway. Duplication is deliberate. The failure
 * it guards against is invisible (yesterday's price renders perfectly) and its
 * cost is the partner programme rather than a broken layout, so one layer of
 * defence is not enough.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "grace period" and no configuration knob. A licence
 * term is not a preference.
