/**
 * Time-tracker extension — the first extension, and the reference for the
 * contract. It contributes a page (`/time`), a dashboard widget ("Diese
 * Woche"), a nav entry, a permission, a settings section, and i18n strings.
 *
 * `island` / `entrypoint` are package subpaths the host's Astro/Vite resolves
 * (see this package's `exports`). The widget entrypoint is an `.astro` shell
 * that embeds a hydrated React island, proving both server render + client
 * hydration flow through the contract.
